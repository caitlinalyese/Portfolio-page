	  <h3> About Me</h3>
	  <p> My name is Caitlin Pierce and I will be graduating from Delgado Community College in August 2020 with a CTS in Website Design. While attending Delgado and taking classes like Adobe Photoshop, Web Foundations, etc, I have learned a vast amount of things from these classes and improved on my creativity skills as well.&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Even so, my learning does not stop here! I plan on continuing my education not only in web developing, but I plan on attending a university to get my degree in Respiratory Therapy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
